 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.
 As things usually go in open source, we gorged ourselves on fixes and improvements instead.
 But all to your benefit. Weâ€™ve had "842 commits by 125 authors":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master
 since the release of the last beta!</p>

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.
 So please welcome the Rails 3 release candidate!
 You install, as always, with *gem install rails --pre*.</p>

 <p>Most of the fixes have been of minor significance, but we did manage to dramatically speed up Rails 3
 development and startup speed for larger applications
 (Basecamp went from insufferable to about 2.3 levels of enjoyment).</p>

 <p>Speed is now pretty good across the board except for part of Arel that Active Record now depends on.
 Weâ€™ll be making sure we get performance of Active Record back to at least 2.3 levels before release.</p>

 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.

 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.
 As things usually go in open source, we gorged ourselves on fixes and improvements instead.
 But all to your benefit. Weâ€™ve had "842 commits by 125 authors":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master
 since the release of the last beta!</p>

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.
 So please welcome the Rails 3 release candidate!
 You install, as always, with *gem install rails --pre*.</p>

 <p>Most of the fixes have been of minor significance, but we did manage to dramatically speed up Rails 3
 development and startup speed for larger applications
 (Basecamp went from insufferable to about 2.3 levels of enjoyment).</p>

 <p>Speed is now pretty good across the board except for part of Arel that Active Record now depends on.
 Weâ€™ll be making sure we get performance of Active Record back to at least 2.3 levels before release.</p>

 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.
 As things usually go in open source, we gorged ourselves on fixes and improvements instead.
 But all to your benefit. Weâ€™ve had "842 commits by 125 authors":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master
 since the release of the last beta!</p>

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.
 So please welcome the Rails 3 release candidate!
 You install, as always, with *gem install rails --pre*.</p>

 <p>Most of the fixes have been of minor significance, but we did manage to dramatically speed up Rails 3
 development and startup speed for larger applications
 (Basecamp went from insufferable to about 2.3 levels of enjoyment).</p>

 <p>Speed is now pretty good across the board except for part of Arel that Active Record now depends on.
 Weâ€™ll be making sure we get performance of Active Record back to at least 2.3 levels before release.</p>

 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.
 As things usually go in open source, we gorged ourselves on fixes and improvements instead.
 But all to your benefit. Weâ€™ve had "842 commits by 125 authors":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master
 since the release of the last beta!</p>

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.
 So please welcome the Rails 3 release candidate!
 You install, as always, with *gem install rails --pre*.</p>

 <p>Most of the fixes have been of minor significance, but we did manage to dramatically speed up Rails 3
 development and startup speed for larger applications
 (Basecamp went from insufferable to about 2.3 levels of enjoyment).</p>

 <p>Speed is now pretty good across the board except for part of Arel that Active Record now depends on.
 Weâ€™ll be making sure we get performance of Active Record back to at least 2.3 levels before release.</p>

 <p>High off Baltimore Pandemic and Yellow Tops, I believe we promised a release candidate shortly after RailsConf.
 As things usually go in open source, we gorged ourselves on fixes and improvements instead.
 But all to your benefit. Weâ€™ve had "842 commits by 125 authors":http://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.0.0.beta4...master
 since the release of the last beta!</p>

 <p>Now itâ€™s time to just say good is good enough, otherwise we could keep on with this forever.
 So please welcome the Rails 3 release candidate!
 You install, as always, with *gem install rails --pre*.</p>

 <p>Most of the fixes have been of minor significance, but we did manage to dramatically speed up Rails 3
 development and startup speed for larger applications
 (Basecamp went from insufferable to about 2.3 levels of enjoyment).</p>

 <p>Speed is now pretty good across the board except for part of Arel that Active Record now depends on.
 Weâ€™ll be making sure we get performance of Active Record back to at least 2.3 levels before release.</p>
